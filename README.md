# InSorg: An Instance Segmentation Method Tailored for Irregular Shapes and Small-Scale Organoids


## 📝Introduction

InSorg is an intelligent organoid image analysis platform integrated with state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning techniques. It enables high-throughput segmentation, detection, and quantitative analysis of brightfield organoid images, automatically extracts key biological metrics, supports multi-modal image inputs, and thus significantly improves the efficiency of workflows in cancer research and personalized medicine.

### • Environment Setup

```bash

# Environment and Dependency Installation Workflow (InSorg Project)
# 1. Create a conda virtual environment named InSorg_env with Python 3.8 (core runtime environment for the project)
conda create -n InSorg_env python=3.8
# 2. Activate the InSorg_env environment (all subsequent installations are executed in this isolated environment to avoid global dependency conflicts)
conda activate InSorg_env
# 3. Install the PyTorch framework (core dependency for deep learning computations; the latest compatible version for Python 3.8 will be installed if no specific version is specified)
pip3 install torch 
# 4. Install and upgrade the OpenMIM tool (package management tool for OpenMMLab projects, facilitating the installation of MM-series libraries)
pip install -U openmim
# 5. Install MMEngine via mim (MMEngine is the foundational runtime framework of OpenMMLab, providing universal engineering capabilities)
mim install mmengine 
# 6. Install MMCV (fundamental computer vision library of OpenMMLab, offering core CV operators and tools)
pip install mmcv
# 7. Batch install remaining project dependencies (requirements.txt is the custom dependency list of the project, including all packages not installed individually)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## ➡️Usage
The experimental validation was performed on a computing server equipped with NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

### • Dataset
The gastric and intestinal organoid dataset was randomly split into training, validation, and test subsets at a ratio of 8:1:1, with the detailed dataset structure presented as follows:
```bash
InSorg/
├── data/
│   ├── coco/                      # Root directory for COCO-format dataset
│   │   ├── train/                 # Training set images (aligned with original train set, following COCO naming conventions)
│   │   │   ├── train.image        # Training set image list file
│   │   ├── val/                   # Validation set images (aligned with original val set)
│   │   │   ├── val.image          # Validation set image list file
│   │   ├── test/                  # Test set images (aligned with original test set)
│   │   │   ├── test.iamge         # Test set image list file
│   │   ├── annotations/           # COCO-format annotation files (core: JSON files containing instance segmentation masks)
│   │   │   ├── instances_train.json  # Instance segmentation annotations for training set (replaces original label/train/)
│   │   │   ├── instances_val.json    # Instance segmentation annotations for validation set (replaces original label/val/)
│   │   │   └── instances_test.json   # Instance segmentation annotations for test set (optional, replaces original label/test/)
```

### • Training

```shell script
# Activate InSorg Conda environment
conda activate InSorg_env
# Enter InSorg project root directory
cd Insorg
# Launch model training on GPU 2 with InSorg.py configuration
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python tools/train.py  InSorg/InSorg.py
```

### • Testing 

```shell script
# Run model test on GPU 2 with InSorg.py config; --weights specifies pre-trained model weights
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python tools/test.py InSorg/InSorg.py -- weights
```
