# InSorg: An Instance Segmentation Method Tailored for Irregular Shapes and Small-Scale Organoids


## 📝Introduction

InSorg is an intelligent organoid image analysis platform integrated with state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning techniques. It enables high-throughput segmentation, detection, and quantitative analysis of brightfield organoid images, automatically extracts key biological metrics, supports multi-modal image inputs, and thus significantly improves the efficiency of workflows in cancer research and personalized medicine.

### • Environment Setup Configuration

Automatic environment setup, please be patient.

```bash

# This creates an isolated environment to avoid conflicts with existing packages
conda create -n orgline_env python=3.10

# This switches to the OrgLine environment for package installation
conda activate orgtrans_env

# Git is required to clone the repository from GitHub
conda install git

# This downloads the complete source code to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/shang0321/OrgTrans.git

# Change to the project directory containing all necessary files
cd OrgTrans

# Install dependencies from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## ➡️Usage

---
### • Dataset Preparation

- Properly organize your organoid datasets for training and inference by following this directory structure:

```bash
OrgTrans/
├── datasets/
│   ├── image/                # Training set
│   │   ├── train/           # Training images
│   │   ├── test/            # Test images
│   │   └── val/             # Validation images
│   ├── label/                # Bounding box annotations
│   │   ├── train/           # Annotations for training images
│   │   ├── test/            # Annotations for test images (optional)
│   │   └── val/             # Annotations for validation images
│   ├── create_txt.py         # Script to create .txt files for dataset
│   └── generated_files/      # Folder to store generated files
│       ├── test.txt          # Contains paths of the test set images
│       ├── train_1_percent.txt # Contains paths of 1% of the training set (fully-supervised)
│       ├── unlabeled_1_percent.txt # Contains paths of 1% of the training set (unlabeled)
│       └── val.txt           # Contains paths of the validation set images
│
└── # After running create_txt.py, the following files will be generated:
    ├── test.txt              # Contains the test set image paths
    ├── train_1_percent.txt   # Contains 1% of the training set images (fully-supervised)
    ├── unlabeled_1_percent.txt # Contains 1% of the training set images (unlabeled)
    └── val.txt               # Contains the validation set image paths
```

- Execute the following command to generate data set splits:

```bash
# This switches to the OrgTrans environment for package installation
conda activate orgtrans_env

# Navigate to the datasets directory
cd datasets

# You can modify the instructions to choose any proportion of fully-supervised labels, such as 1%, 5%, or any other value. Here’s how you can update it:
# Make sure that 'data' and 'create_txt.py' are in the same directory.
python create_txt.py
```



### • Training

```shell script
# Navigate to the supervised training configuration directory
cd OrgTrans/configs/sup
# Run supervised training using the 'sup.yaml' configuration file
python train.py --cfg configs/sup/sup.yaml

# Navigate to the semi-supervised training configuration directory
cd OrgTrans/configs/ssod
# Run semi-supervised training using the 'transfer_ssod.yaml' configuration file and load the weights from supervised training
python train.py --cfg configs/ssod/transfer_ssod.yaml
```

### • Testing the Semi-Supervised Model

```shell script
python val.py --cfg configs/ssod/transfer_ssod.yaml --weights 
```
